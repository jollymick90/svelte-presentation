  <h2>Library</h2>
  <p>
    A library is a collection of code, data, or tools created to be reused by
    different programs, instead of rewriting the same functionality from
    scratch.
  </p>
  <h2>Framework</h2>
  <p>
    A reusable structure for software development. A framework is a predesigned
    structure that provides a foundation for building applications. It defines
    how different components should interact, offering reusable patterns and
    conventions.

  <h2>Library vs Framework</h2>
  <p>
    Library → A library provides optional, plug-and-play functionality. The
    developer stays in control and decides when and how to call the library’s
    functions. Framework → A framework defines the overall structure and flow of
    an application. It is in control, and decides when and how to call the
    developer’s code (and, if needed, specific libraries). (“Hollywood
    Principle” (“Don’t call us, we’ll call you”).
